> What are data structures and algorithms ?

- A Data Structure is an arrangement of data in a computer's memory or disk.
- **_Data Structures_** include Arrays, Strings, Linked List, Stack, Queues, ...
- **_Algorithms_** manipulate the data in these structures in various way such as searching for a particular data item
  or sorting data

### Characteristics of Data Structures

| **Data Structure**    | **Pros**                                                            | **Cons**                                                                  |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Array                 | Quick insertion, very fast access if index is known.                | Slow search, slow deletion, fixed size                                    |
| Ordered Array         | Quick searcher than unsorted array                                  | Slow insertion and deletion, fixed size                                   |
| Stack                 | Provide last in, first out access                                   | Slow access to other items                                                |
| Queue                 | Provide first in, first out                                         | Slow access to other items                                                |
| Linked List           | Quick insertion, quick deletion                                     | Slow search                                                               |
| Binary Tree           | Quick search, insertion, deletion (if the tree is remains balanced) | Delete algorithms are complex                                             |
| Red-black tree        | Quick search, insertion, deletion. Tree always balanced             | Complex                                                                   |
| 2-3-4 Tree (B-Tree)   | Quick search, insertion, deletion. Tree always balanced             | Complex                                                                   |
| Hash Tables           | Very fast access if key known. Fast insertion                       | Slow deletion, access slow if the key not known, inefficient memory usage |
| Heap (Priority Queue) | Fast insertion, deletion, access to largest item or smallest item   | Slow access to other items                                                |
| Graph                 |                                                                     |                                                                           |
| Skiplist              |                                                                     |                                                                           |
| Trie                  |                                                                     |                                                                           |
