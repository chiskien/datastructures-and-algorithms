# Object-Oriented Design and Analysis

## Resources:

- Head First Design Patterns:
- Design Pattern: Gang of Four
- The Object-oriented Thought Process

## Object-Oriented Programming:

### Classes

> Classes are building blocks of Java application. A _class_ can contain methods (functions, variables, initializations,
> and codes.

### Objects

### Abstract Classes

### Interfaces

## Design Principles:

1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from those which stay the same
2. Program to interfaces, not implementations.
3. Favor composition over inheritance
4. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
5. Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification

## Design Patterns:

1. [Strategy Pattern](strategy)
2. [Observer Pattern](observer): defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes
   states, all of its
   dependents are notified and updated automatically.
3. [Decorator Pattern](decorator): attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a
   flexible
   alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
4. [Factory Pattern](factory):
5. Singleton Pattern
6. Command Pattern
7. Adapter and Facade Pattern
8. Template Method Pattern
9. Iterator and Composite Pattern
10. State Pattern
11. Proxy Pattern
12. Builder Pattern
13. Flyweight Pattern
14. Prototype Patter
