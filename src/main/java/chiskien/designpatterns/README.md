# Object-Oriented Design and Analysis

## Design Principles:

1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from those which stay the same
2. Program to interfaces, not implementations.
3. Favor composition over inheritance
4. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
5. Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification

## Design Patterns:

1. Strategy Pattern
2. Observer Pattern: defines an one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object change states, all of its
   dependents are notified and updated automatically.
3. Decorator Pattern
