# Observer Pattern

> - Like when you subscribe to a news journal, or a youtubers.
> - Every time, the youtubers release a new video, you (a subscriber) will get a notification about it, and you get information
    about it.

- **Observer Pattern defines a _one-to-many_ dependency between objects so that when one object changes its state, all
  of its dependents are notified and updated automatically**

### Why does this pattern relate to one-to-many relationship?

- The `Subject` is the object that contains the state and controls it.

## Loose Coupling
